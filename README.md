search_engine
=============

A simple search engine, still very much in alpha, based on the Udacity Introduction to Computer Science search engine.
As of now, this project can crawl the majority of links on most webpages and can create an index of its crawling. Still 
TODO is the actual ranking and output of webpages. I hope to eventually develop this project enough to use on my personal
blog. (And, accordingly, I hope I get to posting on my blog enough to merit the inclusion of a search engine.)
